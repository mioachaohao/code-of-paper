Topological Analysis, Endogenous Mechanisms, and Supply Risk Propagation in the Polycrystalline Silicon Trade Dependency Network

1.This code folder contains the code for replicating the results of the article "Topological Analysis, Endogenous Mechanisms, and Supply Risk Propagation in the Polycrystalline Silicon Trade Dependency Network." The code is written in R for running the analysis, and the visualization code is written in Python Jupyter for creating visualizations.

2.The results in the article correspond to sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. Therefore, the folder names are also named as 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 to replicate the respective results.

3.My folder location is "D:," and the R code initially requires setting the environment address. If your code files are not located in "D:," you need to change the value of the environment_file_path variable to the location of your code files. Python does not require manually setting the environment address and can run in any location.

4.The results of running the code correspond in order to the results in the article. However, the "community" column in "wb_nodelist.xlsx" in section 4.1 may have slight variations due to the inherent randomness in community partitioning results.

5.All the code is original. Please give proper credit if you use it. If you encounter any issues while replicating the results, you can contact me at miaochaohao2022@163.com.
